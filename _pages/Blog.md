# Programming Blogs

## [Intro to Data Visualization](https://jshleap.github.io/programming/writting-jDataViz/)
From histograms to dashboards: An introduction to data visualization with python

## [Python fundamentals](https://jshleap.github.io/python/writting-jPython_first/)
This lesson deals with the first interaction of Python starting at the built-in data-structures such as variables, lists, and dictionaries. We will build up the knowledge you need, even if is your first time doing serious programming.

## [Basic bash](https://jshleap.github.io/programming/writing-jBasic_BASH/)
This very basic tutorial is to introduce a complete novice in the use of bash. The idea is that the person will be able to move around the Compute canada Clusters and be more or less comfortable with it. It is by no means comprehensive nor is going to make you a bash ninja, but it will allow you to deal with clusters, and some minor manipulations.

# Data Science Blogs

## [Recipe2Cuisine](https://jshleap.github.io/data%20science/writing-jRecipe2Cuisine/)
In this post I want to share my experience with an Natural Language Processing (NLP) data challenge I tackled at Insight Data Science.

# Bioinformatics Blogs

## [QC in NGS data](https://jshleap.github.io/bioinformatics/writting-jNGS_tutorial/)
This tutorial is intended to understand basic NGS statistics (mainly obtained with FastQC), and some of the steps required to fix or ameliorate some of the issues. 

## [Megan software methods](https://jshleap.github.io/bioinformatics/writting-jMEGAN_notes/)
This tutorial (more like a conversation and notes), will try to introduce to some aspects of the Software MEGAN. I will assume that you are more or less familiar with metagenomics pipelines, and will focus more on how MEGAN does things.

## [Blast+ command line](https://jshleap.github.io/categories/bioinformatics/)
We will discuss basic usage of the blast+ tools (available in Compute Canada Clusters such as Graham, Beluga and Cedar) or at the NCBI FTP).
